# 234124_HW3_Tests

First, you can download all of the cpp files and run the tests independently. In addition, you can download ```advancedFinalCheck``` and perform the following on csl3:
```
chmod +x advancedFinalCheck
./advancedFinalCheck submission.zip
```
where ```submission.zip``` is your final submission file. This will run all of the latest (downloads the latest tests upon running) tests with valgrind in addition to the official ```finalCheck```.

Note that you should all still run the official ```finalCheck``` in addition.
